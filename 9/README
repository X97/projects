By using what I have learned about doubly and singly linked lists, I was able to
create this binary calculator. I also learned how to make use of the goto function
within this lab. Also, I have the knowledge to compile my program more
efficiently by the use of a Makefile.


=============================================================
Difference between Singly Linked List and Doubly Linked List:
=============================================================

Singly linked list needs two fields (value and next) as opposed to three fields
(value, next, prev) for doubly linked list for each node. i.e doubly linked list
needs more memory space than singly linked list.

Each element in the singly linked list contains a reference to the next element
in the list, while each element in the doubly linked list contains references to
the next element as well as the previous element in the list.

Singly linked list allows traversal in one direction, from head to tail.
Doubly linked list, traversal of the list can be done in both direction, head to
tail or tail to head. i.e Doubly linked list is more flexible and save time than
singly linked list.

Insertion and deletion of a node in list is more complex in doubly linked list
than a singly linked list because of more pointer manipulations.

Insertion of new node at the end of the doubly linked list take less time than a
singly linked list because of tail pointer of doubly linked list.
