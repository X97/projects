1.)

        x = 2, y = 1, z = 1

        x = 2, y = 2, z = 1

        x = 2, y = 2, z = 2

        x = 0, y = 0, z = 1

        x = 0, y = -1, z = -1

        x = 0, y = 0, z = 0

2.)
        Can not have dash "-" in function name and
        function call.

3.)

        output will be: 1
        Why: since while is false, it will iterate once
        and stop. Do while goes through the condition once.

4.)

        output is: f is Not 1.0

        Why: f is declared as a floating point
        and is greater than 1 at the end of the
        for loop.

5.)

        The mistake is that int a = 1.2; not 1,2
        the value takes the floor and is a 1 when
        printed.

6.)

        This program will not print because it is
        missing #include <stdio.h> and <stdlib.h>

7.)

        There is no difference between the two calls
        to scanf, even after removing the space.

8.)

        i : 10
        sizeof(i++) is: 4
        i : 11

9.) Line 8: printf("The date you have entered is %02d-%02d-%4d\n");


10.) Line 6: for(i = 0; i < n; n--)

     i-- should be changed to n--

11.)

        Floating point exception

12.) 8
