my version of gdb commands

Man page for gdb

file - program that is going to be debugged [ex. gdb filename]

backtrace - all stack frames previously are printed [Shortcut: bt]

run - Starts the debugging of the program. [shortcut: r]

list - Lists specified lines or function (up to a certain amount). [shortcut: l]

help - a list of various commands is printed.

break - a breakpoint is set at a location (specified by a numerical value) [shortcut: b]

continue - after a breakpoint, debugged program will resume

step - Goes to the next line one by one until it reaches an end [Shortcut: s]

bt full - All stack frame backtraces are printed

print - Prints the value of an expression in a given step at the time
For a = 0, p a would give 0. [Shortcut: p]

frame - stack frame is chosen/selected and printed

kill - stops the current debugged program and returns to <gdb> for more commands

next - skips function calls and subroutine functions [Shortcut: n]

into b - Stack frames backtraces are printed

disable/enable - breakpoints are enabled
breakpoint are given numerical values (arguments are separated by spaces)

Disable some breakpoints.
Statements are breakpoint numbers with spaces in between.

delete - breakpoints can be removed or expressions are displayed automatically.

watch - Expression has a watchpoint to see if any changes occur during continuation.

Conditional breakpoint - sets breakpoints based on user set criteria

Part 2:

bad.c requested the outputs to be the same, therefore by setting
message equal to msg allows the output to be equal.

product.c had its call function multiplied by 10 in order
to get the correct expected output for 5-10 respective multiple sum

pointer.c needed p to be equal to the &a address of a and
by commenting out the second assignment to allow b to remain and print 1

insert_sort.c by putting y[num_y] = new_y; outside the for loop
it allowed it to properly print the expected outcome

sort_easy.c added another part to the if statement to assure
it will increment and print in order.
