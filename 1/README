This program will be used to calculate various geometric problems such
as the area of a Rectangle, area of of a Circle, Circumference, and more.
It will initially prompt the user a list of options, which the user must enter a
number from 1-11 to choose from those options. Based on the users input, it will
ask the user to enter a value to find the calculation for that selected choice.
The user may quit the program by entering 0 when prompted to choose from the
select list. Upon exiting the program, it will show that the program is quitting.
